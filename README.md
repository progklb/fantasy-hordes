## Systems

### Player movement

Player movement is handled by Unity's navigation mesh system. When the player clicks on the map, a raycast is generated by the `InputManager` to determine the point on the map that has been clicked. The `InputManager` then raises an event containing this position, and the the `PlayerCharacter` listens for this and feeds the position to the `NavigationAgent` to begin navigation.
